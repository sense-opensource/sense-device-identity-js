<p> Sense is a client side library that enables you to identify users by pinpointing their hardware and software characteristics. This is done by computing a token that stays consistent in spite of any manipulation.</p>

#### Bash
```bash
    # Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies)
    npm install
    # or
    npm i

    # Run the playground locally
    npm run playground

    # Build the project and generate the dist folder
    npm run build
```
### JS Integration
```js
    // Include the Sense library 
    <script src="https://cdn.getsense.co/js/v1/senseos/sense-device-identity-js"></script>

    // üåé Setting allowGeoLocation to true prompts the browser to ask for the user's location
    SenseOS.initSDK({ allowGeoLocation: false })
    .then((data) => {
        const { senseId, getSenseDetails, score } = data;

        // ‚úÖ Your code logic here
    })
    .catch((error) => {
